This is my first lambda project.  I built this tool to explore AWS Lambda and Python 3.7 asyncio.  

I started off by basing the data-flow based on [this design pattern](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/resize-images-on-the-fly-with-amazon-s3-aws-lambda-and-amazon-api-gateway/).

At first I was tempted to just use the built in Lambda editor and just use Javascript.  However, the more I dug in, I realized I would have to build the project offline and package up dependencies where I used JS or Python.  

So, with that I decided to go back to more familiar Python territory..
